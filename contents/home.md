<div style="text-align: justify;">

Respected professors, my name is Hou Pingqing. I am from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Anhui University of Technology, majoring in Internet of Things Engineering. My GPA is 3.8 out of 4.5, ranking 13th out of 89 students, and I have achieved a score of 444 in CET-4.

During my undergraduate studies, I led the project “An Improved Product Package Recognition Algorithm for Automated Retail Stores Based on YOLOv11” Through systematic literature review, model improvement, and experimental validation, I proposed the BCSM-YOLO model, and the related work has been published as an SCI paper.

In addition, I actively participated in competitions. I was awarded the Outstanding Award in the Huashu Cup International Mathematical Contest in Modeling and the Second Prize in the MathorCup Big Data Competition, and I have also received multiple university-level scholarships and honors.
In terms of internships and projects, In practice, I interned at Youkeda Network Co., Ltd., contributing to an invoice management system, and independently developed the backend of a “Coffee Chatroom” project.

Looking ahead to my postgraduate studies, I plan to further pursue research in the fields of artificial intelligence or software engineering, improve my research competence and project practice ability, and strive to publish high-quality papers, laying a solid foundation for my future academic and applied research.
